<ul>
<li><h3>AoE2Tools</h3>
Aoe2Tools is an awesome piece of software by Gregstein that makes it as easy as never before to install and manage your Age of Empires II game, including WololoKingdoms, Visual Mods, Recorded Games, Streams and much more!

<p><a href="https://github.com/gregstein/AoE2Tools/releases">AoE2Tools</a></p></li>

<li><h3>WololoKingdoms</h3>
This tool allows you to play the HD Edition DLCs on Voobly and with Userpatch, so you can profit from a huge variety of features, bug fixes and improvements.
Even the ECL (Escape Champions League), a 60000$ tournament official sponsored by Microsoft, is played on this version.

<p><a href="https://github.com/AoE2CommunityGitHub/WololoKingdoms/releases">WololoKingdoms</a></p></li>

<li><h3>AoE2Techtree</h3>
As the name promises, this is the Age of Empires 2 Tech Tree so you can look it up online. There are two sites for this:

<p><a href="https://aoe2techtree.net/">Online AoE 2 Tech Tree</a> (I prefer this one because you can switch civs while scrolled to the right)</p>
<p><a href="https://aoe2techtree.com/">Alternative Online AoE 2 Tech Tree</a></p></li>

<li><h3>AoE 2 Stats</h3>
This is a great site made by Pip. Similar to my Sheet, you can look at unit stats, civilizations and more. The search function makes it very convenient and there's a option to compare several units that's very useful!

<p><a href="https://aoe2stats.com/">Look up Units, Buildings, Civilizations and Techs </a></p></li>

<li><h3>Hotkey Editor</h3>
An online tool for editing hotkeys. There are no restrictions on overlapping keys, and you can set some unusual keys that the in-game editor won't allow. 
You can find presets from pro players as well. When downloading, make sure to set the version to HD 5.0+ if you want to use the hotkey set for HD or WololoKingdoms.

<p><a href="https://aokhotkeys.appspot.com">Online Hotkey Editor</a></p></li>

<li><h3>Captains Mode</h3>
Another great tool by Pip. This allows you to pick and ban civs according to certain rules, as you might know from games like League of Legends. This has been used in several tournaments already.

<p><a href="https://www.aoe2cm.net/">Captains Mode for Age of Empires II</a></p></li>

<li><h3>Team Balancers</h3>
These tools allow you to balance teams according to Elo.

<p><a href="https://aochub.com/tb/">Team Balancer for Voobly</a></p>
<p><a href="https://teamsplitter.surge.sh/">Team Balancer (Elo entered manually)</a></p></li>

<li><h3>AoE 2 Calendar</h3>
Here you can look up when future tournament watches will be played/streamed

<p><a href="https://aoe2calendar.com/">AoE 2 Tournament Calendar</a></p></li>

<li><h3>Notemaster</h3>
A simple tool that you can use to overlay text over the game, e.g. for build orders.

<p><a href="https://www.aoezone.net/threads/aoe2-notemaster-tool.136494/">AoEZone thread for the Notemaster tool</a></p></li>
